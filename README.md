# this repository is for the message mixer project
# the create-cipher program is used to select between three different ciphers (caesar, symbol, or reverse) and then take user input to perform the cipher
# the super-encoder program is used to apply all three ciphers to the user's input using the 'encode' keyowrd
# using the 'decode' keyword with super-encoder.js will allow the user to decode a cipher with the reverse order used in the 'encode' process
